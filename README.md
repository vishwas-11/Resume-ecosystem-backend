# Real-Time Resume Ecosystem - Backend API

This repository contains the source code for the backend API of the Real-Time Resume Ecosystem. This powerful, centralized service is designed to manage user authentication and dynamically build professional resumes by integrating with various sub-platforms like hackathon portals, online course websites, and internship platforms.
This MVP was built as a monolithic service, with plans to evolve into a full microservices architecture.
